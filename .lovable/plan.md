## Update Favicon

Replace the current favicon with the uploaded Super Bowl trophy image.

### Steps

1. Copy the uploaded image (`user-uploads://image-2.png`) to the `public` directory as `favicon.png`.
2. Update `index.html` to reference the new favicon with a `<link rel="icon">` tag pointing to `/favicon.png`.
